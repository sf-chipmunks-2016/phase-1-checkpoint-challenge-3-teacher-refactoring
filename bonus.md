# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
It allows you to put in default values or throw an error if the key can't be found instead of returning nil.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?
One problem is that you can't have objects that are multiple things at once. The solution to this is to use Modules and include in order to have attributes/functionality still be multiply-ee inheritable.

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
In order to allow for classes child classes to add functionality simply and easily without breaking the code. It also looks better and makes default values look better.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
